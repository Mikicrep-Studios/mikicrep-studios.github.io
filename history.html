            <p>It was 19.08.2021 and I was bored.<br>
                I decided to start "company" and first name I thought of was Mikicrep Studios.<br>
                I made discord server for it and made channels.<br>
                First annoucement was on 18th september 2021.<br>
                <img src="assets/pics/history/firstannoucement.webp" height="200px"><br>
                I forgot what was it but my guess is that it was "@everyone we have #tickets and you can now create accounts in #tickets".<br>
                Account creation was manual back then.<br>
                You needed to open ticket and send me your username and I would send you token.<br>
                I shortly after (21.9.2021) annouced tha mikicoins were 95% finished and I just needed to finish shop (which i never did lol).<br>
                Also miner existed which would just print few random numbers and you had to screenshot output.<br>
                <img src="archive/zassets/mikicoinslogo.png" height="100px"><br>
                This was original server icon btw, also Mikicoins logo and server name was "Mikicoins" back then.<br>
                8.10.2021 Server got first moderator!<br>
                15.10.2021 I annouced Mikicrep OS and made discord server for it which doesnt exist anymore.<br>
                21.10.2021 Server hit 75 members!<br>
                22.10.2021 Mod apps got closed and we got 3 more mods.<br>
                6.11.2021 We got our server botted by someone named 512long. I got no idea how that happened anyways we got like 200 new members.<br>
                19.11.2021 3 Months of Mikicoins.<br>
                <img src="assets/pics/history/3months.webp"><br>
                3.12.2021 Mikicoins started dying.<br>
                6.12.2021 Server got reworked and finnaly became Mikicrep Studios.<br>
                12.12.2021 I annouced our first game called "SCRG (Some Random Clicker Game)"! 
                It was made in Microsoft NET framework.<br>
                18.12.2021 I made this github site and we switched to it (old URL was mikicrep.000webhostapp.com). 
                This github site was also abandoned for long time.<br>
                19.12.2021 I made my own economy discord bot which was used to gain Mikicoins (250 of its cash = Mikicoin).<br>
                25.12.2021 Our old Minecraft server was released. 
                It didnt last that long.<br>
                30.12.2021 I made afk page trying to moneteize this using arc.io. 
                I will never do it again it was terrible.<br>
                31.12.2021 HAPPY NEW YEAR 2022!!!
